## Overview

Welcome to the exciting world of the Dice Game! This mobile app offers a fun and interactive experience where you can accumulate coins by rolling the dice. This game provides a thrilling opportunity to test your luck and strategy.

## Features

### Home Page Fun

Earn coins by tapping the dice button and rolling a six on the home page.

### Betting Adventure

Head to the "Two or more" page to place bets and increase your coin balance. Be strategic as the bet amount should be less than your current balance.

### Multiple Modes

Choose from three exciting modes - 2 alike, 3 alike, and 4 alike. Win coins by rolling dice with matching numbers in the selected mode.

## Project Highlights

### Wallet Activity

The wallet activity ensures state persistence using the ViewModel approach. The user interface is designed with a constraint layout, accommodating both portrait and landscape modes for a seamless user experience.

### TwoOrMoreViewModel

All required methods in the TwoOrMoreViewModel have been successfully implemented, and comprehensive test cases have been written to verify their functionality.

### TwoOrMoreActivity

The user interface for the TwoOrMoreActivity has been thoughtfully designed, overcoming challenges in data transfer between activities. XML files for both portrait and landscape orientations ensure a responsive layout.

### Back Button Functionality

The back button functionality has been implemented to allow smooth navigation from the TwoOrMoreActivity to the WalletActivity, displaying the updated balance.

### Information Button

An information button has been added to provide details about the game, implemented with a nested scroll view for a smooth scrolling experience.

### UI State Persistence

The app's user interface is designed to maintain its state across orientation changes, providing a consistent experience in both portrait and landscape modes.

### Testing and Accessibility

Rigorous testing, including manual UI interaction and stress testing using the Monkey tool, has been conducted. Instrumented tests using Mockito were challenging but yielded satisfactory results.

The Accessibility Scanner provided valuable suggestions for improving accessibility, addressing issues related to text scaling, color contrast, and TalkBack feature warnings.
